# Food and Eating Habits Analysis

## Project Overview
This project delves into the analysis of food and eating habits based on survey data. It aims to uncover patterns and preferences in dietary habits, focusing on meal frequency, types of diets, and reactions to different food items. The insights from this analysis can inform nutritional planning and health-related research.

## Data Description
The dataset, `Dietary_Habits_Survey_Data.csv`, is compiled from a survey that collected detailed responses about individual eating routines, dietary types, food allergies, and beverage consumption patterns. Key areas of analysis include the impact of diet types on meal frequency and preferences for specific food preparations.

### Columns in the Dataset
- `age`: Age of the respondents.
- `gender`: Gender of the respondents.
- `number_of_meals_per_day`: How many meals respondents eat per day.
- `diet_type`: Dietary preference, e.g., vegetarian, non-vegetarian.
- `allergic`: Food allergies as reported by respondents.
- Various other columns related to specific food and beverage consumption habits.

## Dependencies
To run this project, you will need Python along with several libraries:
- NumPy
- pandas
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
- scikit-learn

Install these with the following command:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas seaborn matplotlib scikit-learn
```

## Visualizations
The analysis script generates various visualizations, including:

Count plots detailing different eating habits.
3D scatter plots examining the relationships between various dietary factors.
Correlation heatmaps to visualize interactions between different dietary variables.
## Conclusions
This analysis offers valuable insights into the common eating habits and dietary preferences among the surveyed population, facilitating a deeper understanding of how different foods and meal patterns are associated with various demographic factors.
